* The phrase "how's it going" is a more common and natural way to ask about someone's well-being in spoken language, and it flows better when spoken aloud.

This revised phrase should sound more natural and conversational when spoken through a Text-to-Speech system.

"Hi, how's your day going so far?"

This version is more suitable for speech synthesis because:

* It starts with a more casual and friendly greeting ("Hi" instead of "Hello")
* It uses a more conversational phrase ("how's your day going so far") that sounds more natural and relaxed when spoken aloud
* The phrase has a better rhythm and pacing, with a slight pause after "Hi" to create a more natural flow
* The tone is friendly and inquiring, which is suitable for a casual conversation
* The emphasis is on "your day" to convey interest and care for the listener's well-being

The original phrase "Hello... how are you?" can sound a bit stilted and formal when spoken aloud, whereas the rephrased version has a more natural and conversational tone.
